    "  - Answer the corresponding questions on OpenTA.\n",

    "* Make a plot of the expected $\\chi^2$ distribution for the relevant number of degrees of freedom and compare with the statistic obtained for the actual data in each case.\n",

    "* What is your *confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis* for each particular case.\n",

    "Finally, you are encouraged to play around and generate data for the same three scenarios but with another random seed. E.g. try with the seed `2019` instead of `1` used in the `np.random.RandomState(1)` initialization in the cell below. What is the outcome of the analysis of these new data sets?"
